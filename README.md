# Shopify API

The ShopifyAPI library allows Python developers to programmatically
access the admin section of stores.

The API is accessed using pyactiveresource in order to provide an
interface similar to the
[ruby Shopify API](https://github.com/shopify/shopify_api) gem.
The data itself is sent as XML over HTTP to communicate with Shopify,
which provides a web service that follows the REST principles as
much as possible.

## Usage

### Requirements

All API usage happens through Shopify applications, created by
either shop owners for their own shops, or by Shopify Partners for
use by other shop owners:

* Shop owners can create applications for themselves through their
  own admin (under the Apps > Manage Apps).
* Shopify Partners create applications through their admin:
  <http://app.shopify.com/services/partners>

For more information and detailed documentation about the API visit
<http://api.shopify.com>

### Installation

To easily install or upgrade to the latest release, use
[pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/)

```shell
pip install --upgrade ShopifyAPI
```

or [easy_install](http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html)

```shell
easy_install -U ShopifyAPI
```

### Getting Started

ShopifyAPI uses pyactiveresource to communicate with the REST web
service. pyactiveresource has to be configured with a fully authorized
URL of a particular store first. To obtain that URL you can follow
these steps:

1.  First create a new application in either the partners admin or
    your store admin and write down your `API_KEY` and `SHARED_SECRET`.

2.  You will need to supply two parameters to the Session class
    before you instantiate it:

    ```python
    shopify.Session.setup(api_key=API_KEY, secret=SHARED_SECRET)
    ```

3.  For application to access a shop via the API, they first need a
    "access token" specific to the shop, which is obtained from
    Shopify after the owner has granted the application access to the
    shop. This can be done by redirecting the shop owner to a
    permission URL, obtained as follows:

    ```python
    shop_url = "yourshopname.myshopify.com"
    scope = ["write_products", "read_orders"]
    permission_url = shopify.Session.create_permission_url(shop_url, scope)
    ```

    Note: Legacy Auth is assumed if the scope parameter is omitted or None

4.  After visiting this URL, the shop redirects the owner to a custom
    URL of your application where a `code` param gets sent to along with
    other parameters to ensure it was sent by Shopify. The following
    code will validate that the request came from Shopify, then obtain
    the permanent access token (with an HTTP request when using OAuth2)
    which can be used to make API requests for this shop.

    ```python
    session = shopify.Session(shop_url, params)
    ```

5.  Activate the session to use the access token for following API
    requests for the shop it was authorized for.

    ```python
    shopify.ShopifyResource.activate_session(session)
    ```

6.  Start making authorized API requests for that shop. Data is returned as
    ActiveResource instances:

    ```python
    # Get a list of products
    products = shopify.Product.find()

    # Get a specific product
    product = shopify.Product.find(632910)

    # Create a new product
    new_product = shopify.Product()
    new_product.title = "Burton Custom Freestyle 151"
    new_product.product_type = "Snowboard"
    new_product.vendor = "Burton"
    success = new_product.save() # save() returns false if the record is invalid

    # Update a product
    product.handle = "burton-snowboard"
    product.save()
    ```

### Saved Session

1.  Follow steps 1-4 from the "Getting Started" section to obtain a session,
    then save the session's token along with the shop_url.

    ```python
    shop_url = session.url
    saved_token = session.token
    ```

2.  Create and activate a new session using the saved shop_url and token.

    ```python
    session = shopify.Session(shop_url)
    session.token = saved_token
    shopify.ShopifyResource.activate_session(session)
    ```

### Console

This package also includes the `shopify_api.py` script to make it easy to
open up an interactive console to use the API with a shop.

1.  Go to https\://*yourshopname*.myshopify.com/admin/api to generate a private
    application and obtain your API key and password to use with your shop.

2.  Use the `shopify_api.py` script to save the credentials for the
    shop to quickly login. The script uses [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) to save
    and load connection configurations in the same format as the ruby
    shopify\_api.

    ```shell
    shopify_api.py add yourshopname
    ```

    Follow the prompts for the shop domain, API key and password.

3.  Start the console for the connection.

    ```shell
    shopify_api.py console
    ```

4.  Enter the following for the full list of the commands.

    ```shell
    shopify_api.py help
    ```

## Using Development Version

Use the `bin/shopify_api.py` script when running from the source tree.
It will add the lib directory to start of sys.path, so the installed
version won't be used.

```shell
bin/shopify_api.py console
```

The development version can be built using

```shell
python setup.py sdist
```

then the package can be installed using pip

```shell
pip install --upgrade dist/ShopifyAPI-*.tar.gz
```

or easy_install

```shell
easy_install -U dist/ShopifyAPI-*.tar.gz
```

## Limitations

Currently there is no support for:

* python 3
* asynchronous requests
* persistent connections
* json format for API requests
